  About us
</h1>
<p>
  We love film here at Tinygiantz, especially short films. Because we understand the amount of skill it takes to tell a great story in a short amount of time. We also know that a lot of great short films get drowned out by other video content on popular
  video sites after getting uploaded. Because of this, we at Tinygiantz have created a space that is updated frequently and where these great films can be easily found and enjoyed without being drowned out.

  No filmmaker has to pay to be seen on Tinygiantz, you just have to tell an interesting story.
